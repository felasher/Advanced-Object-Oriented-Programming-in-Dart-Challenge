# Advanced-Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Dart-Challenge
In this program:

We define the Student and Teacher classes with their respective properties (name, age, grade level for students; name, age, subject for teachers).
Each class has a method (printStudentInfo and printTeacherInfo) that prints out the relevant information.
The School class creates instances of a student and a teacher, and calls their methods to display their information.
